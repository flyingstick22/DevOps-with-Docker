# International Space Station (ISS) location

I modified my old ISS location project and deploy it using Heroku.

1. I created the application using Streamlit
2. I created Dockerfile
3. I created "heroku.yml" that tells Heroku to check Dockerfile for the build
4. I push the project to Heroku by following [these](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-docker-images-heroku-yml) instructions
