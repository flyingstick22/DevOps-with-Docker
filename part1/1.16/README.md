# International Space Station (ISS) location

I modified my old ISS location project and deployed it using Heroku.

1. I created the application (app.py) by usin Streamlit
2. I created Dockerfile
3. I created "heroku.yml" that tells Heroku to check Dockerfile for the build
4. I push the project to Heroku
